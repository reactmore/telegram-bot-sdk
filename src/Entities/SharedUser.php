/**
 * Class SharedUser
 *
 * This object contains information about a user that was shared with the bot using a KeyboardButtonRequestUsers button.
 *
 * @see https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#shareduser
 *
 * @method string          getFirstName() Optional. First name of the user, if the name was requested by the bot
 * @method string          getLastName()  Optional. Last name of the user, if the name was requested by the bot
 * @method list<PhotoSize> getPhoto()     Optional. Available sizes of the user photo, if the photo was requested by the bot
 * @method int             getUserId()    Identifier of the shared user. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so 64-bit integers or double-precision float types are safe for storing this identifier. The bot may not have access to the user and could be unable to use this identifier, unless the user is already known to the bot by some other means.
 * @method string          getUsername()  Optional. Username of the user, if the username was requested by the bot
